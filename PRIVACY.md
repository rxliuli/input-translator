# Privacy Policy for Input Translator

> Last updated: 2026-08-03

## Data Collection

Input Translator does **not** collect any personal or sensitive user data — no browsing history, no page content, no typed text, and nothing that identifies you.

### Anonymous Usage Statistics

The extension sends **at most one anonymous ping per day** to our own infrastructure (extport, running on Cloudflare) so we can see how many installs are active and which versions are in use. Each ping contains exactly:

- a random install identifier (generated locally, not linked to you or your account on any service)
- the extension version
- your browser's UI language (e.g. `en-US`)

From the network request itself our server derives the browser, operating system, and country (the IP address is used only for the country lookup and is **not stored**). Raw pings are deleted after 90 days; only aggregate daily counts are kept. No browsing data, page content, or behavioral data is ever collected.

## Third-Party Translation Services

To translate your input, the extension sends the text you trigger translation on directly from your browser to a third-party translation service based on your chosen settings. The supported providers are:

- **Google Translate** (default, no API key required)
- **Microsoft Translator** (no API key required)
- **OpenAI-compatible API** (user-configured endpoint and API key)

No data passes through or is stored on our infrastructure. The text is sent directly from your browser to the selected service, and only when you explicitly trigger a translation.

## Data Storage

All extension settings and configurations (including API keys, if applicable) are stored **locally in your browser** using the browser storage API. No data is stored on external servers.

## Data Sharing

We do **not** sell, trade, or share any user data with third parties. The only external data transmission is the text sent to the translation service you choose, as described above.

## Open Source

This extension is fully open source. You can review the complete source code at https://github.com/rxliuli/input-translator.
